# FO4-Rebalance-Mod

Overview

This mod rebalances Fallout 4’s progression, economy, combat, and healing systems to create a more challenging, survival-oriented experience. Inspired by Josh Sawyer’s JSawyer mod for Fallout: New Vegas, this project is designed to make every decision matter — from perk choices to how you spend caps.

Key features include:

Slower progression: Leveling is more deliberate, health scaling reduced, and inventory management is stricter.

Scarcer economy: Vendors are poorer, ammo and chems are expensive, and loot is less generous.

Deadlier combat: Enemies die quicker but hit harder, making every encounter a risk.

Expired Stimpack: A weaker healing item that replaces most early-game stimpaks, especially in raider loot.

Perk trade-offs (WIP): Core perks like Rifleman and Gunslinger have been given meaningful downsides, further perk changes are planned but as of yet not implemented.
